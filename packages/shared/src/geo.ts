/**
 * Why "Use my location" didn't work, in words a customer can act on.
 *
 * A browser hands back a bare numeric code and nothing else, and every app that
 * ignores it produces the same complaint: "it's not activating". On iPhone in
 * particular the cause is almost never the page — it is Location Services
 * switched off for Safari, a permission dismissed weeks ago, or simply a slow
 * first fix indoors. Each needs a different sentence, and none of them is
 * "something went wrong".
 *
 * Kept free of DOM types so it can be tested; the browser bits live in each app.
