# Easy Buy Delivery

**Pabili • Padala Delivery Services**

A local, single-municipality delivery platform built as a set of thin frontends
over one shared Supabase backend. It runs three service types — **Food**,
**Pabili** (buy-anything), and **Padala** (point-to-point courier) — on a single
rider network.

The defining model: **no merchant onboarding.** Stores are not partners and do
not log in. The admin manually adds every store and its menu. Riders act as the
bridge — they call the store, pay for the goods out of their own pocket, deliver,
then collect from the customer on delivery.

---

## Why this design

- **Near-zero operator overhead.** No merchant relationships to manage; the admin
  owns all store/menu data.
- **One rider serves multiple stores per trip** (up to 3), which drives the
  per-store fee in the commission math.
- **One backend, several frontends.** A web order and a mobile order are identical
  rows in the same queue — no syncing to build.

## The three apps (roles)

| App | Who | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Customer** | The buyer | Browse stores/menus, place Food / Pabili / Padala orders, pay COD or online, track the rider live. Ships as a **native mobile app** and a **web ordering site**. |
| **Rider** | The courier | Receive & accept orders, call the store, front cash for goods, deliver, collect payment, settle daily commission. |
| **Admin** | The operator | Add stores + menus, manage riders, set fees/commission, control operating hours, monitor orders, run settlements. |

## The three service types

| Service | What it is | Customer pays | Rider fronts cash? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Food** | Order from stores the admin added | Goods cost + delivery fee | Yes |
| **Pabili** | "Buy this for me" — anything | Actual goods cost (per receipt) + delivery fee | Yes |
| **Padala** | Point-to-point courier, nothing bought | Delivery fee only | No |

Padala is the **lowest-risk service to launch first** — no rider cash float.

## Commission (locked formula)

```
Commission = Delivery Fee × 15% + ₱25 × number of added stores
```

"Added stores" = stores beyond the first. Commission is charged on the
**delivery fee + store fees — never on the cost of goods** (goods are a straight
pass-through the rider fronts and the customer repays).

Because most orders are COD, the rider physically holds the operator's
commission. It is collected through a **daily settlement gate**: yesterday's
commission balance must be paid before the rider's account reactivates.

See [`docs/commission-and-settlement.md`](docs/commission-and-settlement.md) for
the full math and settlement flow.

## Suggested stack

- **Frontend:** React / Vite / TailwindCSS (web); React Native / Expo (native).
- **Backend/DB:** Supabase (Postgres + RLS + Realtime).
- **Payments (later):** PayMongo / Xendit.
- **SMS/OTP:** Semaphore.
- **Deploy:** Vercel / Railway.

Ship as one PWA with role-based views first, split into native later where
background GPS is required (rider app).

## Repository layout

```
docs/                     project spec (overview, flows, data model, decisions)
supabase/migrations/      Postgres schema, RLS, settlement functions
packages/shared/          @ebd/shared — pricing/commission/cart/settlement logic + types
packages/supabase/        @ebd/supabase — data-access layer over supabase-js
apps/customer-web/        customer ordering (Food / Pabili / Padala)
apps/rider/               rider app (pool, delivery flow, settlement gate)
apps/admin/               operator dashboard (stores, riders, orders)
```

## Getting started

```bash
npm install          # workspace install (Node 22+)
npm test             # run shared-layer tests (node:test, no build step)
npm run typecheck    # type-check the workspace
```

For the backend, see [`supabase/README.md`](supabase/README.md).

## Status

**Phases 0–2 landed.** Done so far:

- ✅ **Phase 0** — Supabase schema (enums, core tables, unified order queue,
  commission ledger + settlement functions, RLS; validated against Postgres 16)
  and `@ebd/shared` (commission formula, order-cost + cart math, settlement
  gate, order-status state machine).
- ✅ **Phase 1 (Padala)** — `@ebd/supabase` data layer + customer web request
  form + admin rider-approval / live-orders.
- ✅ **Phase 2 (Food)** — admin store/menu management with per-merchant on/off
  toggle, and the customer multi-store cart with ₱25/store fee math.
- ✅ **Phase 3 (Pabili)** — buy-anything request with estimate + spending cap,
  the rider actual-amount update, and confirm-at-cap over-budget handling.
- ✅ **Rider app** — settlement lock gate, order pool + accept, per-service
  status flow, Pabili actual-amount entry, amount-to-collect, and commission
  accrual on delivery.
- ✅ **Admin settlement management** — who owes / who's locked, and mark-paid
  confirmation that settles the ledger and reactivates the account.
- ✅ **Phase 4 (payments + live tracking)** — COD / online / rider-QR payment
  methods with the correct settlement impact, and per-order live rider tracking
  (Supabase Realtime transport + a live-ETA map).
- ⬜ **Real Supabase project wiring** and production map/payment providers —
  see [docs/open-decisions.md](docs/open-decisions.md) (#6, #9).

Frontends run in **preview mode** with sample data until `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` /
`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set. **63 unit tests** pass; all three apps build;
the customer, rider, and admin flows are browser-verified.
